# DEC_poster_template
A poster template for the Department of Cognitive Studies of the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure-PSL.

This poster is forked from the Gemini template and the Univeristy of Chicago, informatic department template. 

There are two versions :
- A first one that is on format 16:9, to be showed online that is **APP_template_poster**;
- A second one, at the A0 format, respecting the better poster guidelines, to be printed and exposed that is **A0_template_poster** (coming soon).

Is the folder **logos** you can find some useful logos and there originals that were modified to fit the poster esthetics. I used *Gimp* to do that. If you want to modify another affiliation to make it fit, do not hesitate to ask me.
